# Week 1

## Introduction
The assignment entails creating a webpage showcasing an image gallery that displays a diverse array of wood textures. Seeing the textures and colors of various woods can inspire new ideas and projects. The textures are usually displayed as individual swatches.
They are small, typically square or rectangular, blocks that display a specific color or material sample. Swatches can also display material samples or texture patterns, helping users visualize how different materials or textures will look in their designs.

## Ideation
When selecting a material from swatches, users may prefer to have access to detailed information about individual material, but presenting this information directly on the main interface can disrupt the user flow and hinder decision-making.
This website uses clickable swatches as interactive elements and modal windows to enhance their experience, so the user can explore the website for creative inspiration and learn about the source plants of different wood materials.

## Process
The development process aims to included organizing content into distinct sections such as an introductory text about wood types, fixed background images, and the main image gallery container. Within the gallery, each wood type was represented in individual image containers with labels and overlays, allowing users to explore different textures and view larger images when hovered over.
