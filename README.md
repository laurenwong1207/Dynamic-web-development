# Week 1

## Introduction
The assignment entails creating a webpage showcasing an image gallery that displays a diverse array of wood textures. Typically showcased as individual swatches, these textures are depicted as small, square or rectangular blocks, each displaying a specific color or material sample. Swatches serve as effective tools for users to visualize different materials or texture patterns, aiding in the exploration of design possibilities and inspiring new projects.

## Ideation
When users are choosing a material from swatches, they often desire access to detailed information about each individual material. However, presenting this information directly on the main interface can disrupt the user flow and impede decision-making. To address this challenge, the website employs clickable swatches as interactive elements and modal windows to enhance the user experience. This approach allows users to explore the website for creative inspiration while also learning about the source plants of different wood materials. 

## Process
The development process aims to included organizing content into distinct sections such as an introductory text about wood types, fixed background images, and the main image gallery container. Within the gallery, each wood type was represented in individual image containers with labels and overlays, allowing users to explore different textures and view larger images when hovered over.
